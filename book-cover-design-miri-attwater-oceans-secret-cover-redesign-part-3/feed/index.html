					<description><![CDATA[@Christina - you are the right track with what&#039;s wrong with the picture, but off on the color. Hint: What color are Miri&#039;s tails? :)

Oh, and the dress suggestion? I think you&#039;re going to like the cover for Book 2, All that Glitters!

Even on longer books, I&#039;ve heard that one problem with ebooks is that readers are surprised when they get to the end because it&#039;s hard to judge how much you have left in an ebook. It&#039;s even harder when you put a preview of another book at the end. But I also can&#039;t say it&#039;s not partially my fault as the writer - I maybe shouldn&#039;t have broken the one too long book into three, or I should have done it with more skill. :) Of course it&#039;s working on the &quot;skill&quot; part that has delayed book 2.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally understand why you need to change the cover. I like the idea of showing her face. Well done to TechnoTim for all the hard work he&#039;s putting into it! So, what&#039;s wrong with the color? Does she have brown eyes in the book? I can&#039;t remember, but I was one of those readers who was disappointed when it came to an end. P.S. Maybe her dress could be a shimmering green (of a lighter tone) to offset the bright orange/red hair.]]></description>
