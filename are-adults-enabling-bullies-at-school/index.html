But in addition to things that make me happy, like crafting and cooking, I also – occasionally – think about BIG questions. Sometimes I amuse myself that I could solve all those big questions if anybody would just ask. 🙂</p>
<p>But when I think about BIG questions that pertain to kids, more often than not, as a parent, I’m not really sure what the right answer is. Raising kids is tricky business!</p>
<p>The issue I was thinking about recently pertains to issues kids face. If this gets to be a habit, maybe I’ll make a category for that, but at the moment it will just stand on its own.</p>
<h1>Are Adults Enabling Bullies at School?</h1>
<p>You probably grew up hearing the stories of bullies. The kind that steals your lunch money. Or your lunch. Or maybe you were harassed by exactly that kind of bully.</p>
<p>I, myself, was never tortured by bully as a child, even though I was always one of the tiniest kids in the class. At least if some kid was trying to intimidate me I was blissfully unaware. So I grew up more thinking that bullies were a legend of schools of the past, characters made only slightly more real by those terrible after-school-movies that were popular in the 70s.</p>
<p>But now it seems that you hear about bullies in the news all the time. Child and teen bullies are still here and more menacing than ever. One theory is that the anonymity and remoteness of social media makes bullying easier. But that doesn’t explain the seeming increase in face-to-face bullying between kids starting as young as elementary school.</p>
<p>Is it a real increase, or are parents just more aware and alarmed by it? For now, let’s assume that it’s a real increase.</p>
<p>Violence in society is often debated. Movies are violent. Computer and video games are violent. Real violence kills children in the streets of the inner city. I, myself, abhor violence in books and an on-screen. In short, I can’t stomach it.</p>
<p>In spite of that, I would argue that “western society” as a whole is less violent than it has been in the past. We don’t gather in stadiums to watch men fight lions to the death like they did in Rome. We don’t gather in the town square to watch mass executions with the guillotine like they did during the French Revolution. We don’t take picnic lunches and sit under parasols on the hills above the battlefield and watch men die in mass like they did during the Civil War. (I just recently found that last one out, and I’m still shocked by it.)</p>
<p>Yes, there are still places in the world where atrocities are occurring even as I type, but I would argue that we are still progressing. At least we are appalled by it and not watching the real occurrence as entertainment. And these atrocities are not happening in your average school.</p>
<p>What is true in your average school is that corporal punishment is no longer allowed. Fewer parents spank their children. I’m not bringing that up to say that undisciplined children are the problem. I’m bringing that up to point out the physical means of settling differences and disciplining kids has decreased, so why are bullies threatening in physical ways that they have seen less modeling of?</p>
<p>I started wondering about this when I heard about a kid at our local elementary school who was cornered in the bathroom and felt physically threatened. The matter was brought up with school personnel and the issue was addressed. The situation, at least for now, seems to be better.</p>
<p>Because the parents of the victim want to make sure this doesn’t happen again, they also talked to the kid about how they can change their behavior keep them from being a victim of bullying. They told him that if he feels cornered, in spite of what he’s been taught about violence not being the answer, he should fight his way out. His response was to break into tears that he would get sent to the principal’s office. The parents told them they would support him and be right in the office with him if this happened. But this gets to my thought.</p>
<p>Zero tolerance for fighting in school, not matter who started it, is typical. I think this is a slight but significant difference in the way fighting was viewed when we were in school ourselves. My husband is one of the least confrontational men I know, and even he has stories about physically standing up to bullies.</p>
<p>Instead of protecting kids, does this zero tolerance rule actually give bullies more power? Because now bullies can threaten or pick a fight knowing that a “rule follower” won’t fight back for fear of getting in trouble with the adults. Fear that fighting back will tarnish their permanent school record. I admit that I’m reluctant when I tell my own kids to fight back because they might get in trouble at school. My husband can give them more specific instructions and with much more enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I think the issue is further clouded by the awareness that issues are not always black and white. We are reluctant to pin blame on a kid in case we are wrong and being unfair. We don’t want to tarnish the “alleged bullies” permanent school record when we can’t be certain whose fault it was, and so we punish both kids. But is this fair if one of them is innocent?</p>
<p>If we tell our kids that fighting back is never the answer, are we making them weak? Why do we not give our children permission to defend themselves from harm? Are we creating sheep that are in danger of getting hurt by more dangerous bullies as they get older?</p>
<p>If we give kids permission to fight back, will we increase the amount of fighting in school? Are we telling them that violence is the answer?</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the answer is. Will giving our kids the courage and permission to stand up for themselves in a physical way if necessary increase or decrease bullying and violence? What do you think?</p>

			<p>Listening to the radio this morning I heard an interesting conversation about some recent research on this topic.  What I took away from my casual listening, while in the midst of morning activities, was this – Kids have a limited perspective so the harm comes when they think such things will always happen to them, that people will always act mean or not like them.  One way to address this is to help them see what the bully might be feeling that makes them act this way.  To kids at least, feelings can change, which gives them hope.<br>
 I don’t know whether I got this exactly right or whether the interview addressed the topic of how the child should respond in the moment, such as by fighting back or turning the other cheek, so I’m going to look it up.<br>
…<br>
Okay, I just called the radio station (KUT in Austin, TX) and they were extremely helpful in finding this story for me.  Here’s the link:<br><a href="http://www.kutnews.org/post/study-teach-teens-bullies-can-change#.USVVGyWCcgg.email" rel="nofollow">http://www.kutnews.org/post/study-teach-teens-bullies-can-change#.USVVGyWCcgg.email</a><br>
To give you the gist, the story intro is, “If teenagers believe people are able to change, it can help reduce aggression in school. That’s the major finding of a new study from the University of Texas.”</p>

			<p>I hadn’t heard about that study but it was interesting. I clicked over to the full study. It was complex and I’m definitely no expert 🙂 but I believe it would be accurate to say this study tried to measure  “desire for revenge.” It involved written questions, mostly written responses, and sometimes on-line games. What was measured was then “desire for vengeance” as how they would feel in an imagined incident, or because of the way they were “treated” in the game. Study 1 showed teens who thought that others could not change were more likely to interpret any action as intentional and had more “aggressive desires” in turn.  Study 2 showed that if students learned information that caused them to realize that others might be able to change, they had less aggressive interpretations of the same incident. Study 3 was the same as Study 2 but showed it over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>I found it especially interesting because the main example given was exactly a type of scenario we have gone over with our kids before – sometimes things really are an accident and not meant to pick on you, so don’t jump to conclusions about a single incident. They might have really accidentally bumped into you and their response afterward can be influenced by all kinds of things, including embarrassment.</p>
<p>This was not the case in the incident that got me thinking about this. I’m not suggesting that  we tell every kid, “if someone is mean to you, hit them!” In the incident I was referring to, it was something that had been escalating over more than two years. The “victim” here was not thinking about vengeance; he was just scared! It was more about the child not having to feel helpless and powerless at the moment they feel they are in imminent physical danger. There is a different between revenge and protecting yourself.</p>
<p> Now of course the kid still might change. And I think that at this age there is a real chance that they will. But meanwhile, the victim shouldn’t feel like he’s at the bully’s mercy. </p>
<p>I still think the study above is interesting. I hope they are planning to do some follow-up studies where these theories are taught to a big enough population of kids to see if they have a real reduction in violence and bullying at school. Bullying is definitely a complex issue! Thanks for dropping in to discuss it.</p>

			<p>WOW – thanks for reading that scientific article and summarizing it for us.  It is interesting. It seems to address how to talk to a child about a bullying incident after the fact, but doesn’t really shed much light on how to prepare a child to avoid or respond to a bully.  </p>
<p>This question also brings to mind a classic Andy Griffith episode.  I believe Andy taught Opie some basic self defense techniques and encourages him to face the bully, based on the theory that the bully is really a chicken at heart and will back down (and that the fear is worse than the resulting black eye).  Not sure we’ve learned much more about the issue in the last 6 decades. </p>
<p>Okay, better check this out, too, in case Ms. Ivy has some extra time…<br>
…Found it!  Here’s a site with a synopsis of “Opie and the Bully”.<br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0512526/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0512526/</a></p>

			<p>Wow, what a brain-cranking post! Time to get the cogs turning. 🙂</p>
<p>I think part of the problem with the whole “bullying” issue is that we try to dump all types of bullying into the same bucket. But the fact is, not all kids bully for the same reason. In our current state of “no tolerance of bullying” we’re also not tolerating a lot of other things–for instance, that kid who got in major trouble at school for eating his pizza into the shape of a firearm. As much as some parents like to wish that this isn’t true, sometimes trying to suppress natural curiosity and course-of-events, or cut out the processes kids need to go through to figure out how to actually work things out in society without the authority figure barging in first…this can backfire and cause anger problems, etc, which leads to one type of bullying.</p>
<p>Another type that I’ve noticed is acted out toward “smart” kids who use their smartness to essentially bully (non-acknowledged) other kids by making them feel stupid, so those kids in turn lash out in other ways that are often categorized as bullying. It’s really a great big mess made into a bigger mess. Part of this type of bullying boils down to the way education is often set up: favoring one or two types of learners and leaving the others feeling inferior.</p>
<p>That’s my 50-cents, anyway!</p>

			<p>I agree; it is such a complicated issue! Thanks for bringing up some more ways that adults might be contributing to, rather than solving, the problem. You bring up some really good points that hadn’t occurred to me. Especially the type of “mental smartness bullying;” that hadn’t occurred to me even though I’ve seen it. You are right, kids are trying to work a lot of things out. They’re going to decide on their own that some things don’t work and also going to make some mistakes. As my hubbys says, “They’re kids. They’re learning. That means they don’t know everything yet.” (And do adults even know everything?)</p>
<p>I really debated even posting on this topic, but I decided *discussing* things is so important. Thanks so much for adding to the discussion!</p>
