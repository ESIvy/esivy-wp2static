					<description><![CDATA[Thank you! To my surprise, quite a few people turn to the web when their looking for information on manners. I think of the basics as common knowledge, but when lots of families don&#039;t gather around the table for meals, it might not be as commonly known as I thought. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I admit to disliking switching the fork back and forth. And the one that goes with it - cut only one bite of meat at a time! 

Hmm... maybe I&#039;ll look into some of the history some more. I know I learned that when you set the table you should make the knife blade face toward the plate - and not to the diner on your right. Because if the blade faces the diner beside you it&#039;s too easy to pick it up and cut them! It sounds like dinner used to be violent. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s one that always generates a lively discussion at our house - Switch the fork to your left  (or right hand if you&#039;re a lefty) while cutting meat.  And when you&#039;re done cutting, put the knife down and switch the fork back before eating. Perhaps that&#039;s two - anyway someone always notes that in Europe it&#039;s considered polite to keep holding your knife while you eat, which leads to the inevitable &#039;manners are meaningless cultural relics&#039; comment and yada, yada, yada... It is interesting sometimes to track down why some behaviors are considered bad manners.  For example, I&#039;ve heard that in the old west, you were supposed to keep both hands on the table so everyone could trust that weren&#039;t holding a gun!]]></description>
