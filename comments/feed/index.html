					<description><![CDATA[Oh, so sorry you lost your files! It&#039;s always frustrating when computers do things like that. Did you find your backups yet? Take a look at Step 2. SET SCRIVENER’S AUTO-BACKUP LOCATION and see if you can find the location where you were saving your auto-backups. You should have multiple copies there and go back some copies and find your material. 

Also check out the other Scrivener sources above. And try asking the Google+ community, Scrivener Users, https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109597039874015233580. 

I hope you find them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something awful just happened. Maybe I was doing smth wrong all this time with Scrivener- I&#039;m a new user. My comp. shut down last night on its own- so today I opened my Scrivener and the last chapter I worked on for a few days- puff and disappeared, erased completely, with all the comments and notes- and even the extra pieces related to the chapter that I saved in a separate folder. Nothing even that was there and saved as a backup before. Just the whole section is cleaned- even the icon in the outline on the left changed from a document to a blank. I save everything as I work on it by pressing Ctrl S, and the Scrivener creates the backups in the installation folder. I just click on the icon when I start-0 and it opens where I last stopped. It worked great and this strange thing never happened before. So much work is lost, it&#039;s insane. I wonder if it&#039;s still somewhere. Normally, when I shut down the computer, the Scrivener creates a backup- but this time the comp shut down itself (could be a lightning at night) and Scr. not just didn&#039;t save the latest changes- it REMOVED the section I was working on completely, including what was saved by a previous backup! Any ideas what had happened and if there&#039;s a way to remedy this?]]></description>
