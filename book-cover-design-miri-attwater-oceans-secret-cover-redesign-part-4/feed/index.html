					<description><![CDATA[Haha! Aren&#039;t blogs wonderful? I&#039;ve got an image intensive post I&#039;m trying to write, and Wordpress won&#039;t arrange the pictures well at all. So I&#039;m trying to find a good lightbox plug-in - I&#039;ve been looking for carousel and that&#039;s apparently the wrong term! 

Oh, wait! While typing this I had an epiphany - if I just center all my pictures it will fix my problem of the text keeping up with the images. Face-palm. It won&#039;t look quite like I want but it will work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, so it was the eye color! It&#039;s looking good! I&#039;m not able to log in to my IntenseDebate to moderate comments on my blog, just to let you know why yours is not there. I&#039;m still waiting for support to respond to my problem. Have a wonderful day!]]></description>
